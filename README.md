## About

This is the website for [safesandlocks.com.au](https://www.safesandlocks.com.au).

The website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.

The website was forked from [Scotch Jekyll Bootstrap](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme), which is a great starter theme with very helpful documentation.

The website makes use of the [Reen Bootstrap3 Theme](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/reen-made-for-designers-one-multi-page-WB00PN23G), which contains documentation on html elements that are available to be added.
